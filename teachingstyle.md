My teaching style is a blend between eastern thought and western sensabilites. It is a blend between the easts concept of "come and figure it out for yourself" and the wests approach to guided study. I give students the tools to solve the problem but then the freedom to explore their own solutions. It's only after they have their own solution can we talk about other possibilites. 
I find students tend to enjoy this style and as well as myself. For this reason, I enjoy doing and recieving code reviews.
